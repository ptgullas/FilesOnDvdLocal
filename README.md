# FilesOnDvdLocal
I have a Microsoft Access database that I've used for years to catalog various media files that I archive to DVD. These files generally have most or all of their metadata fields in their filenames. Until now, I've imported each DVD's worth of file data into the Access database using a somewhat tedious process involving an Excel spreadsheet, and then manually entering data into Access forms. This WPF application is intended to speed up this process, by reading the data from the filenames, and importing everything directly into Access.

Built for .NET Framework 4.6 because the database is on a Windows Vista laptop (and I don't want to move it just yet), but now that it's mostly finished, I still have issues running this on Vista (for various reasons).
